> Triggers: Why does marking a ticket as ‘Solved’ only notify the customer when the agent comments?
When the agent doesn’t comment, there is no notification to the customer.
 
For some tickets (asking customer for info, don't need response) we don't want to notify customer. It’s usually comparable in effort/effect to add a comment like “thanks, you too!” when we want to send the ‘solved with comment’ email. 

> Ticket 'Closed' Status: What it means

Tickets can't be manually mark as closed; only the system can do that. It marks a ticket as closed based on amount of time after solved (set in business rules > automations). 

Closed tickets can't be altered or reopened; to continue the conversation, a ‘follow-up request’ is created that references the closed ticket.
