> Triggers: Why does marking a ticket as ‘Solved’ only notify the customer when the agent comments?
When the agent doesn’t comment, there is no notification to the customer.

For some tickets (asking customer for info, don't need response) we don't want to notify customer. It’s usually comparable in effort/effect to add a comment like “thanks, you too!” when we want to send the ‘solved with comment’ email. 

> Ticket 'Closed' Status: What it means

Tickets can't be manually mark as closed; only the system can do that. It marks a ticket as closed based on amount of time after solved (set in business rules > automations). 

Closed tickets can't be altered or reopened; to continue the conversation, a ‘follow-up request’ is created that references the closed ticket. 

> Questions about the 'Replacement Cost' or 'Canince Liability Exclusion' charges on the policy document

+ Canine liability exclusion: required on all policies. Only excludes dogs that are considered 'high-risk'—see [Common Questions and Responses][1] Google Doc for list of breeds and response example.
+ Replacement cost: required on all Jetty policies, even though it's under the 'optional' section. This insures property at replacement cost value (how much it costs to buy a similar quality item) instead of actual cost value (how much the original item is worth after depreciation). See Claims FAQ [Article][2].

*Common confusion* Thinking that it means all dogs are not covered
