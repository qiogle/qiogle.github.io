##### Customer asked how to change majors at her school (likely wrong recipient)
`Customer` 

Hello Karen

I've been thinking a lot about my major and not feeling 100 present sure of it. I sat down and researched more and found that Journalism and Mass Communication is a better fit for me. It focuses more on the photography. How would I go about changing my major?

Thanks.

Hi Anais,

If you're a newly admitted student, you can fill out a major change application; if you're a current student, you should contact an advisor in the major you're interested in pursuing to start the process (according to the asu website). Hope that helpsâ€”though my specialty is more insurance ðŸ˜‰  

Best of luck with your decision! 

Karen
