##### Customer asked how to change majors at her school (likely wrong recipient)
`Customer` 

Hello Karen

I've been thinking a lot about my major and not feeling 100 present sure of it. I sat down and researched more and found that Journalism and Mass Communication is a better fit for me. It focuses more on the photography. How would I go about changing my major?

Thanks.

Hi Anais,

If you're a newly admitted student, you can fill out a major change application; if you're a current student, you should contact an advisor in the major you're interested in pursuing to start the process (according to the asu website). Hope that helpsâ€”though my specialty is more insurance ðŸ˜‰  

Best of luck with your decision! 

Karen

## Being proactive

##### Customer emails to correct a typo in her personal information, agent noticies other typos
`Customer` 

My address zip code is incorrect it should b 60611

`Jetty Agent`

Thanks for letting us know! I've corrected that for you.

I wanted to check a couple more things to make sure you're properly covered: 
1) You listed your address as "850 South Lake Shore Drive", which our maps are showing as a park. Is it possible you meant 850 North Lake Shore Drive?  
2) I noticed your email is "warrennoel@yahoo.com" and the name on your account is "Warren Nowl". Does this look correct? 
3) We heard from your leasing agent about adding "North Lake Shore Drive Realty Company LLC" as an additional interest and wanted to confirm that with you. 

Let me know,

Karen
