##### Customer asked how to change majors at her school (likely wrong recipient)
`Customer` 

Hello Karen

I've been thinking a lot about my major and not feeling 100 present sure of it. I sat down and researched more and found that Journalism and Mass Communication is a better fit for me. It focuses more on the photography. How would I go about changing my major?

Thanks.

Hi Anais,

If you're a newly admitted student, you can fill out a major change application; if you're a current student, you should contact an advisor in the major you're interested in pursuing to start the process (according to the asu website). Hope that helps—though my specialty is more insurance 😉  

Best of luck with your decision! 

Karen

## Being proactive

##### Customer emails to correct a typo in her personal information, agent noticies other typos
`Customer` 

My address zip code is incorrect it should b 60611

`Jetty Agent`

Thanks for letting us know! I've corrected that for you.

I wanted to check a couple more things to make sure you're properly covered: 
1) You listed your address as "850 South Lake Shore Drive", which our maps are showing as a park. Is it possible you meant 850 North Lake Shore Drive?  
2) I noticed your email is "warrennoel@yahoo.com" and the name on your account is "Warren Nowl". Does this look correct? 
3) We heard from your leasing agent about adding "North Lake Shore Drive Realty Company LLC" as an additional interest and wanted to confirm that with you. 

Let me know,

Karen

## Zendesk

> Triggers: Why does marking a ticket as ‘Solved’ only notify the customer when the agent comments?
When the agent doesn’t comment, there is no notification to the customer.

For some tickets (asking customer for info, don't need response) we don't want to notify customer. It’s usually comparable in effort/effect to add a comment like “thanks, you too!” when we want to send the ‘solved with comment’ email. 

> Ticket 'Closed' Status: What it means

Tickets can't be manually mark as closed; only the system can do that. It marks a ticket as closed based on amount of time after solved (set in business rules > automations). 

Closed tickets can't be altered or reopened; to continue the conversation, a ‘follow-up request’ is created that references the closed ticket. 

> Questions about the 'Replacement Cost' or 'Canince Liability Exclusion' charges on the policy document

+ Canine liability exclusion: required on all policies. Only excludes dogs that are considered 'high-risk'—see [Common Questions and Responses][1] Google Doc for list of breeds and response example. *Common confusion* Thinking that it means all dogs are not covered

+ Replacement cost: required on all Jetty policies, even though it's under the 'optional' section. This insures property at replacement cost value (how much it costs to buy a similar quality item) instead of actual cost value (how much the original item is worth after depreciation). See Claims FAQ [Article][2].
